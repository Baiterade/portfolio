## About

> I got my first coding experience making video games in high school.

I took a few more related classes, and eventually ended up attending UTSA's
Full Stack Flex Bootcamp. I have a passion for problem solving, teamwork, and learning and 
Iâ€™m eager to utilize and expand my skill set as part of an innovative, quality-driven team 
building premium experiences for the web.
